             * The middle values are the hidden layer dimension. There is none in this model because it's quite an easy
             * IA, but you can try to add some and see what happens.
             * 
             * The last value is the output layer dimension, you can choose to have 2 output :
             *  - One for "should jump"
             *  - One for "should not jump"
             *
             * You will just have to check which one got the higher value.
